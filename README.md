## October 2018: monero hardfork reminder

there is an upcoming monero hardfork on October 18, 2018. If you want to mine monero after this date, you have to update to this new miner version (2.8.1) before the fork!

## April 2018: breaking change

this docker image now uses [XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)
